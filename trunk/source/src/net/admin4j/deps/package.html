This package contains dependency classes for Admin4J.  The contents of this
package contains open source software that Admin4J uses, but did not create.
</p>

<p>
You may notice that we have changed/refactored the package name for all of the 
the products we use.  This is a Win/Win.  It's a win for users as the don't have 
to worry about possible class conflicts between what Admin4J uses and what their 
application may or may not already use.  It's a win for us in that we don't
have to worry about possible differences between the versions of these products 
that you use and the versions we tested and developed with.
