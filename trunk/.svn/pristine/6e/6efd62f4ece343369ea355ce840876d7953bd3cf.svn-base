							<title>Changing the Log Level for applications at runtime</title>
							
							<p>Admin4J allows you to change logger reporting levels at runtime.  The advantages are the
							   following:</p>
							   
							<p>Putting a logger in DEBUG no longer requires a container recycle.</p>
							<p>Many shops put bureacracy in front of container configuration changes in production.  This
							  administrative servlet can be safely made available to support developers in all environments.</p>

										<title>Installing Log Level administration tool</title>
										
										<note>If you followed the installation procedure detailed in the <a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>
												section, there is no need to install the Log Level Administration tool separately.  Only follow this procedure if you're
						 						not using the Admin4J Home Page Servlet.</note>
														
										<p>Add the following servlet and servlet mapping to your applications web.xml:</p>
																					<source><![CDATA[
<servlet>
		<servlet-name>LogLevel Servlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>net.admin4j.ui.servlets.LogLevelServlet</servlet-class>
		<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>LogLevel Servlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/admin4j/logLevel</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
