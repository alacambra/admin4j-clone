					<title>Overview</title>
					<p>Admin4J is a base set of administration utilities for Java EE applications.  </p>
					<p>Admin4J is open source and uses an Apache 2.0 License.</p>
					<p>Admin4J will do the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Track and summarize exceptions generated by applications so the most severe issues are more easily identified.</li>
						<li>Detect thread contention problems at runtime.  Problems are logged and administrators optionally notified.</li>
						<li>Detect memory issues at runtime.  Problems are logged and administrators optionally notified.</li>
						<li>Track and display performance metrics</li>
						<li>Provides a SQL Performance Measurement page.</li>
						<li>Provides a Log Level administration page to change log levels at runtime.  Currently supports log4j and jdk logging.</li>
						<li>Provides a Web-Based File Explorer administration page with optional security features to limit display and change capabilities.</li>
						<li>Provides a Java EE Filter to automatically detect application errors.  Problems are logged and administrators optionally notified.</li>
						<li>Provides a web-based JMX browser for environments that don't expose JMX ports for remote browsing.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Admin4J is intentionally made so that it's easy to install.  Furthermore, every effort has been made to keep our library dependancy list to a minimum.</p>
					<p>This project started as a set of utilities the authors created to support their own projects.  We noticed over time that we were routinely installing these utilities in all of our applications.</p>
