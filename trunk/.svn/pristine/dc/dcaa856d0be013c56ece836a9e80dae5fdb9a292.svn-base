This file is where we document useful notes for Admin4J developers.

Currently, this project is organized to use a JDK 1.7.  The following folders should be defined
as 'source' folders in your IDE:
src
test

While the following contain java source, they should *not* be declared source folders as they require 
compilation under a different JDK:
jdbc30
jdbc40
jdbc42

Markup for the presentation layer can be found in folder 'ftl' (yes - we use Freemarker).

When you first set up your project, you *will* show compile errors until you run the build and place a copy 
of the admin4j-commons.jar in your classpath.  This jar contains Admin4J dependencies that are slightly
'refactored' to reside in different packages.
