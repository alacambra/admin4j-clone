							<title>What is HotSpot?</title>
							
							<p>HotSpot will examine thread dumps and collect data on all threads in a "Running" or "Blocked" state.
							   HotSpot collects thread dumps to examine on a configured interval (default is 30 seconds).  HotSpot
							   will summarize the information it collects on demand via a servlet display.</p>
								
							<p><strong>Why would I use HotSpot instead of a profler?</strong>  Good question.  HotSpot operates the 
							   same way many profilers do, but with a much longer interval between observations.  HotSpot will 
							   <strong>not</strong> replace your profiler.  Profilers are great when you have already identified the process
							   that requires tuning.  <strong>HotSpot helps you identify that process.</strong></p>
							   
							<p><strong>Wouldn't running a profiler on a load test give me the same information?</strong>  No.  Load tests
							   are scripted.  That means that they are constructed to emulate specific user activities.  Which user activities
							   are scripted?  Well, sometimes developers are working on specific information, but more often than not they
							   are making assumptions about the most widely used features of their application.  HotSpot allows you <strong>not</strong> to
							   have to "guess" or "make assumptions" about which parts of applications are most frequently executed.  HotSpot can
							   tell you actually what is most frequently executed in a production environment.</p>
							   
							<p><strong>Is HotSpot safe to use in a production environment?</strong>  Yes.  Hotspot can safely be used in 
							  production environments.  Furthermore, you control how intrusive HotSpot is by manipulating the length of the
							  work/sleep cycle it uses.  The default of 30 seconds was determined by experimenting with different settings 
							  on a production application (it's what the writers of this utility most frequently use).</p>
		
							<p>The HotSpot monitor operates on a work/sleep cycle.  The length of the 'sleep' cycle
							  is configurable.</p>

				<title>Installing the Hot Spot Utility</title>
				
				<note>If you followed the installation procedure detailed in the <a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>
						 section, there is no need to install HotSpot separately.  Only follow this procedure if you're
						 not using the Admin4J Home Page Servlet.</note>

				<p>Add the following servlet to your applications web.xml:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
<servlet>
<servlet-name>Hot Spot Display Servlet</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>net.admin4j.ui.servlets.HotSpotDisplayServlet</servlet-class>
<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>Hot Spot Display Servlet</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/admin4j/hotSpot</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
				]]></source>

				<p>The following configuration parameters are supported for HotSpot.  You specify
					 these parameters as init parameters on the display servlet:</p>
					 <table>
						<tr>
							<th>Parameter</th>
							<th>Required</th>
							<th>Default</th>
							<th>Description</th>
					 </tr>
					 <tr>
							<td>sleep.interval.millis</td>
							<td>N</td>
							<td>Default 30000 (30 sec)</td>
							<td>Amount of time in millis monitor will sleep between checks.</td>					 
					 </tr>
					</table>

<section>
				<title>HotSpot Utility usage in containers servicing multiple applications.</title>

				<p>You only need one Hotspot monitor per JVM.  If the container you which to monitor services
					 multiple applications, it's on necessary to install the HotSpot monitor startup servlet in one of 
					 those applications.</p>
